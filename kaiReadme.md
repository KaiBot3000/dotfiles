# What the Hell is this
Everyone is different, and getting to know each other can take time. My goal with this doc is to put together a cheatsheet to help teammates gain context on my approach to working together. It is NOT a checklist of requirements, and is always a work in progress. I update it depending on the team I'm working with, and feedback is greatly appreciated!


## Motivations
- Do No Harm: Just because we can, doesn't mean we should.
- Get Shit Done: I love doing hard things with a solid team.
- Help People: Nothing makes me happier than helping someone learn or build a new thing
- Build Relationships: Good communication requires trust
- Boost Equality: I want everyone to feel included and have ownership over their work.


## Needs

### From Manager
- Direct and actionable feedback about how my actions affect them and others so I can improve
- Guidance on internal politics (For example, I need to know when I'm pushing too hard or not enough, pissing people off, or caring about the wrong things)
- Help setting work-specific goals

### From Teammates
- Direct and actionable feedback about how my actions affect them so I can improve
- Honest code review so I can improve as an engineer and contribute meaningfully (I want to hear when there's a better way to do something, and why)
- Thoughtfulness around communication style (For example, when I'm teaching people I often ask lots of questions and look things up with them. That doesn't mean I need you to step in and take over, I'm just teaching them how to find things and debug)

### From Peers
- Direct and actionable feedback about how my actions affect them so I can improve
- A good-faith effort to help themselves- ex: reading the docs and asking in slack before pinging directly
- Acknowledgement for potentially unsurfaced help (ex: If I regularly spend time helping someone out in a backchannel after they couldn't get help from whomever they were working with, I appreciate it when that help is surfaced to my team or manager)


## Schedule
This is a work in progress and will shift as I adjust to the culture here, but here's my starting point:
- I work much better in mornings than evenings.
- I have a dedicated office at home and focus well there, and also like being in an office with coworkers when possible.
- I keep my calendar updated.

## Communication
I have a very strong preference for copious and transparent communication, especially when working in distributed teams. I learn a lot from other people debugging, answering questions, and spending time in public team channels, and will almost always pull conversation there rather than DM. Asking questions in public requires vulnerability and supporting that is important to me.

### Style
- I'm direct and transparent, and tend towards over-communication.
- I have an expressive face and I'm *really* bad at lying so I just don't, sometimes to my detriment.
- I work best when I have context into why we need the work I'm/we're doing. If I can't have details, "[Person] and I talked it over and we have reasons, but can't share them" is wayyyy better than "I'll get back to you on that." I acknowledge that this comes with responsibility to handle this information carefully, both in how I handle additional context and how I pass that information on to others. 
- I work towards consensus, while recognizing it's not always possible.
- I'm introverted and happier in small groups, especially when I'm getting to know people.

### Medium
- Slack > email for timely information.
- I like to think things through before acting, and do that better in writing than through talking. Large meetings with no agendas or facilitation are not a good medium for me to express ideas and collaborate.
- I prefer slack pings over interruptions at my desk
- I absorb written information better than spoken info, so I'll often gravitate towards written docs over learning from video. This is true for videochat, too, although...
- If communication feels tense for anyone involved, I prefer in-person or videochat. It's much easier to miscommunicate via text.

### Feedback and Recognition
- I prefer critical/constructive feedback privately via slack or in person / video in most situations. I don't need that for things like code review.
- I enjoy recognition for my work in team/public channels, and try to call out the good work of others and give them credit for their ideas.
- I prefer to handle interpersonal challenges face-to-face or over videochat.


## Big Moods
I'm expressive and honest about how I'm feeling, which is something of a superpower. I've seen over and over again that teams do their best work when they trust each other and acknowledge that feelings are part of the devlopement process.

### Mood Drains
tl;dr, behaviors that signal lack of respect for me or others

- People taking over my keyboard / doing things for me rather than showing/telling me how to do it myself
- Responding to questions with context I already know but never answering the question.
- Interrupting people

### Mood Rechargers

Long term: 
- Relationship building: it's much easier to misread communication styles when people don't have prexisting relationships with each other
- Shipping: I try to keep a stash of smaller, low-priority tasks like doc fixes to work on when I'm frustrated / working on a migraine / need a break.

Short term:
- Walks outside
- Snack/stretch breaks
- Uninterrupted focus time
- Facetime to talk things through a while later
