## Motivations
- Do No Harm: Just because we can, doesn't mean we should.
- Help People: Nothing makes me happier than helping someone learn or build a new thing
- Build Relationships: Good communication requires trust
- Boost Equality: I want everyone to feel included and have ownership over their work.
- Get Shit Done: I love doing hard things with a solid team.


## Needs

### From Manager
- Direct and actionable feedback about how my actions affect them and others so I can improve
- Guidance on internal politics: I need to know when I'm pushing too hard or not enough, pissing people off, or caring about the wrong things
- Help setting work-specific goals

### From Teammates
- Direct and actionable feedback about how my actions affect them so I can improve
- Honest code review so I can improve as an engineer and contribute meaningfully
- Thoughtfulness around communication styles and how biases can affect their actions

### From Peers
- Direct and actionable feedback about how my actions affect them so I can improve
- A good-faith effort to help themselves- ex: reading the docs and asking in slack before pinging directly
- Acknowledgement for potentially unsurfaced help (ex: If I regularly spend time helping someone out in a backchannel after they couldn't get help from whomever they were working with, I appreciate it when that help is surfaced to my team or manager)


## Schedule
This is a work in progress and will shift as I adjust to the culture here, but here's my starting point:
- I work much better in mornings than evenings.
- I have a dedicated office at home and focus well there, and also like being in an office with coworkers when possible.
- I keep my calendar updated including blocking out time I need to focus.
- I don't have email on my phone, but I can change that if needed.


## Goals
I am so stoked to be learning a new stack, but that means I have a lot of catch-up to do around tooling; I think that will take a while and I'm not sure how to set goals around it. BUT soon I'd like to have a good handle on how it all fits together and be able contribute meaningfully to the team. That means being able to work independently, being familiar enough with the codebase to debug problems, and having an idea of where to start on new features.

Short term:
- get up to speed; learn the team, our workflow, and our domain
- contribute by improving onboarding docs
- get familiar with codebase
    - be able to run tests
    - be able to change code and have an idea of what errors mean

Longer term (1 year):
- ??? I need help with this


## Communication

### Style
- I'm direct and transparent, and tend towards over-communication.
- I'm *really* bad at lying so I just don't, sometimes to my detriment.
- I work best when I have context into why we need the work I'm/we're doing. If I can't have details, "[Person] and I talked it over and we have reasons, but can't share them" is wayyyy better than "I'll get back to you on that." I acknowledge that this comes with responsibility to handle this information carefully, both in how I handle additional context and how I pass that information on to others. 
- I work towards consensus, while recognizing it's not always possible.
- I'm introverted and happier in small groups, especially when I'm getting to know people.

### Medium
- Slack > email
- I like to think things through before acting, and do that better in writing than through talking. That sometimes means I don't speak up much in meetings.
- I prefer slack pings over interruptions at my desk
- I absorb written information better than spoken info, so I'll often gravitate towards docs over learning from video. This is true for videochat, too, although...
- If communication feels tense for anyone involved, I default to in-person or videochat. It's much easier to miscommunicate via text.

### Feedback and Recognition
- I prefer critical/constructive feedback privately via slack or in person / video in most situations. I don't need that for things like code review.
- I enjoy recognition for my work in team/public channels, and try to call out the good work of others.
- I prefer to handle interpersonal challenges face-to-face or over videochat.


## Moods
### Mood Drains
tl;dr, behaviors that signal lack of respect for me or others

- People taking over my keyboard / doing things for me rather than showing/telling me how to do it myself
- Responding to questions with context I already know but never answering the question.
- Interrupting people

### Mood Rechargers

Long term: 
- Relationship building: it's much easier to misread communication styles when there's no prior experience
- Shipping: I try to keep a stash of smaller, low-priority tasks like doc fixes to work on when I'm frustrated / working on a migraine / need a break.

Short term:
- Walks outside
- Snack/stretch breaks
- Uninterrupted focus time
- Facetime to talk things through a while later

### How to Tell My Mood

I have a very expressive face and a hard time hiding things. If I'm grumpy I'll often have conversations like: "Hey Kai, can I ask you about this orange problem?" "Yeah, with the caveat that I'm a little cranky today :)" OR "I'm focussing right now; can it wait an hour?"

If I'm feeling sensitive (grumpy, frustrated, need heads-down time) I'll often work away from my desk, either from a couch/meeting room or from home. I try to set slack statuses that reflect that, like "Heads down, please do not disturb."

Note: I'm prone to migraines but can almost always work through the early stages, although the pain makes me less patient. I tell people directly when I'm irritable or working on a headache.
